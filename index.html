    <p class="text">Judge Jerry Taylor donated $100,000 to the College of Nursing at the State University to create an endowed scholarship.</p>

<p class="text">Taylor was said to be so impressed with the nurses who helped his ailing brother, he felt compelled make the donation.</p>

<p class="text">He and his wife wanted to create the Nursing Scholarship to benefit incoming freshman nursing students who meet academic requirements and have financial need.</p>

<p class="text">He believes that they do so much good in the world that it is necessary to help them out and give them as much support as possible.</p>

<p class="text"><q>We&#146re thankful to have such a giving person help out our school, people like him are what keeps this program running and helps us achieve our professional goals,</q> a student said.</p>

<p class="text"><q>A world without good nurses isn&#146t a world I want to live in,</q> said Taylor.</p>

<p class="text"><q>I hope my donation will make a difference for the students.</p></q>

<p class="text">Judge Taylor says he plans to make more donations in the future and might even donate to other school at the university.</p>

<p class="text">His primary focus at the moment, however, is the college of nursing. Taylor is already planning a date for his next donation.</p>
